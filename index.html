            <b>What would happen if everyone on earth stood as close to each other as they could<br>
             and jumped, everyone landing on the ground at the same instant?</p>
        <p>-Thomas Bennett(and many others)</b></p>
        <p>
            This is one of the most popular questions submitted to this blog.It's been examined before, including by a<br>
            <b><a href ="https://scienceblog.com/" target ="_blank">ScienceBlog</a></b> post and a <b><a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book" target="_blank">Straight Dope aritcle</a></b>.
            They cover the kinematics pretty well. However,they don't<br> tell the whole story.
        </p>
        
        <p>Let's take a closer look.</p>
        
        <p>At the start of the scenario, the entire Earth's population has been magically transported together into one<br>place.</p>
        <img src = "pop.jpg"> 
        <p>
            This crowd takes up an area the size of Rhode Island. But there's no reason to use the vague phrase "an area<br> the size of Rhode Island".
            This is our scenario; we can be specific. They're <i>actually</i> in Rhode Island.
        </p>
        <img src = "ri.jpg">
        <p>At the stroke of noon,everyone jumps.</p>
        <img src = "pop.jpg">
        <p>
            As discussed elsewhere,it doesn't really affect the planet. Earth overweigs us by factor of over ten trillion.On <br> average, we humans
            can vertically jump maybe half a meter on a good day. Even if the Earth were rigid and<br> responded instantly, it would be pushed down 
            by less than an atom's width.
        </p>
        <p>Next,everyone falls back to the ground.</p>
        <img src = "pop.jpg">
        <p>
            Tehnically, this delivers a lot of energy into the Earth, but it's spread out ovear a large enough area that it<br> doesn't do much
            more than leave footprints in a lot of gardens. A slight pulse of pressure spreads through the<br> North American continetaln crust 
            and dissipates with little effect. The sound of all those feet hitting the <br>ground creates a loud, drawn-out roar which lasts many seconds.
        </p>
        <p>Eventually, the air grows quiet.</p>
        
        <p>Second pass.Everyone looks around.</p>
        <img src = "pop.jpg">
        <p>There are a lot of uncomfortable glances.Someone coughs.</p>
        <img src = "pop.jpg">
        <p>
            A cell phone comes out of a pocket. Within seconds, the rest of the world's five billion phones follow. All of<br/>
                them-even those compatible with the region's towers- are displaying some version of"NO SIGNAL". The cell <br/>
                networks have all collapsed under the unprecedented load.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside Rhode Island, abandoned machinery begins grinding to a halt.
        </p>
        <p>
            The T.F. Green airport in Warwick, Rhode Island handles a few thousand passengers a day. Assuimg they got <br/>
            things organized (including sending out scouting missions to retrieve fuel),they could run at 500% capacity<br>
            for years without making a dent in the crowd.
        </p>
        <img src = "ri.jpg">
        <p>
            The addition of all the nearby airports doesn't change the equation much. Nor does the region's light rail<br> system.
            Crowds climb on board container ships in the deepwater port of Providence, but stocking sufficient<br> food and water for a lonng sea
            voyage proves a challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rhode Island's half-million cars are commandeered. Moments later, I-95, I-195, and I-295 become sites<br> of the largest traffic 
            jam in the history of the planet. Most of the cars are engulfed by the crowds, but a lucky few <br> get out and begin wandering the 
            abandoned road network.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some make it past New York or Boston before running out of fuel. Since the electricity is probably not on at<br/>
            this point, rather than find a working gas pump, it's easier to just abandon the car and steal the new one. Who<br/>
            can stop you? All the cops are in Rhode Island.
        </p>
        <p>
            The edge of the crowd spreads outwards into southern Massachusetts and Connecticut. Any two people who<br/> meet are
            unlikely to have a language in common, and almost nobody knows the area. The state becomes a<br/>patchwork chaos of coalescing
            and collapsing social hierarchies. Violence is common. Everybody is hungry and<br/>thirsty.Grocery stores are emptied.
            Fresh water is hard to come by and there's no efficient system for<br> distributing it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Within weeks, Rhode Island is a graveyard of billions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The survivors spread out across the face of the world and struggle to build a new civilization atop the prestine<br/>
            ruins of the old. Our species staggers on, but our population has been greatly reduced. Earth's orbit is<br/> completly
            unaffected-it spins along exactly as it did before our species-wide jump.
        </p>
        <p>
            But at least now we know.
        </p>
